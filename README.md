## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- React - JS library
- TypeScript
- SaSS - for styles
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- React Testing Library
- Jest
- Vite

### What I learned

I got in deep my SaSS skills for styles and implementing theme colors. Besides, I implemented a menu font option where the user can switch the font family of the entire project.

### Continued development

I'm going to focus my new learning path on use a React Framework, like Next.js or Remix.js, preparing me for the real situations tha I'll have. Also, I'd like to get in deep on unit testing, use other options like Cypress or Vitest.
